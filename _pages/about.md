I am a software engineering PhD student at the [Software and Societal Systems Department](https://www.s3d.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), where I am advised by [Dr. Claire Le Goues](https://clairelegoues.com/). My research interests are primarily in ML for software engineering, software testing and program analysis. 

Prior to starting my PhD, I attended [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), where I worked with [Dr. Milos Gligoric](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~gligoric/) on the topics of mutation testing and test generation. We were able to apply mutation testing to the domain of formal verification, where we mutated proof definitions and used the results of this testing to detect incomplete specifications. For more details about this work and my other papers, see the [publications](https://kjain14.github.io/publications/) tab. 

**I am planning to graduate in May 2025 and am on the job market this year looking for industry research scientist roles. Please reach out if you are interested ([Publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YBZt0-AAAAAJ&hl=en) and [CV](https://www.kushjain.com/files/Jain_Kush_CV_CMU.pdf))!**
